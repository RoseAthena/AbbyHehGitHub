    <h2>Dancing is cool, right? Unless you're not that great at the dance. Dance is fun... 
      Even if you THINK you're not good at it!
    I also like music. Piano, viola, a little bit of ukulele... I don't practice the ukulele that much though... Whoops!
      This is my first page that I've ever coded... it's cool, but not amazing.</h2>
  
      <h2>I have a cat. Her name is Gracie, and she's SOOOOOOO lazy! She's a Tordie Tabby so she's pretty much all the colors a
    cat could be. I love cats and dog lovers, so don't attack me I just have a cat because I used to have a dog, but he died
    :(. I love animals they're SOOOOOO cute!</h2>
    
    <h2>You're gonna need to prepare yourself for this paragraph. I LOVE Kpop! My favorite band is BTS!! Don't Attack me...
      I also love Seventeen, Blackpink and EXO!! My bias in BTS is J-hope OMG HE'S AN AMAZING DANCER AND THAT'S WHY I LIKE TO
      DANCE AHHHHH!!! <3</h2>
      
      <h2> My friends are great. They're crazy, but great. They all are kinda different. That causes problems sometimes, but
        usually it works out. Three of my friends names start with K, weird information, but I find it interesting. I have
        another friend who's very special, but she lives in New York soooo... Yeah. Friends are great. Until their not, then
        they're not so great :)</h2>
